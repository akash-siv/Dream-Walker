# Low-Cost Wearable Solution for Mitigating VR Motion Sickness

## Project Summary
This project presents a low-cost wearable leg device leveraging embedded Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to mitigate Virtual Reality (VR) motion sickness by enabling standing-based locomotion control.

## Main Contributions
- Custom IMU dataset collected from 4 participants.
- Preprocessing using frequency-domain (FFT) and statistical feature extraction.
- Lightweight Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained and optimized for microcontroller deployment.
- End-to-end system achieving ~85% macro F1 score with under 100ms latency.
- Custom SteamVR driver integration with Bluetooth HID communication.
